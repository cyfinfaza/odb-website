	<h2>Our Mission</h2>
	<p>
		Our Daily Bread was established in 1983 by the nine Catholic churches of York County, in
		conjunction with thelocal Catholic Charities. From the very beginning it was the intention of
		the founding group lo establish the program on an ecumenical basis and involve as many Jewish
		and Protestant congregations as well as the Catholic churches. Now more than 60 church and civic
		groups have been recruited to participate in supplying and serving the hot casseroles of food
		and cleaning up after the meals have been served. Many more churches and organizations support
		Our Daily Bread financially.
	</p>
	<p>
		Our Daily Bread Soup Kitchen became a reality on September 13, 1983. That day, 1 2 guests came
		to the basement of Cristo Salvador Church, 235 East South Street, York, Pennsylvania, to enjoy a
		nutritious hot meal served by Paula Moyer Koch, the Manager, and volunteers from a local church.
		Within a period of three months, the average daily number of people served rose to 107, and 30
		church congregations from the surrounding area offered to supply hot casseroles one day each
		month to feed the guests.
	</p>
	<p>
		On September 12, 2021, the 38th anniversary of Our Daily Bread, it is important to note that
		over 2.5 million meals have been served, or a daily average of 286.
	</p>
	<p>The soup kitchen is under the management of Paula Koch.</p>
